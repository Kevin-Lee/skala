# Skala [v0.0.5](https://github.com/Kevin-Lee/skala/issues?q=milestone%3A0.0.5+is%3Aclosed)

## Fixed
* `tryWith` should evaluate the parameter once (#17)

## Changed
* Update libs (#15)
* ~~`tryWith` should return `Try[T]` instead of `T` (#18)~~ (dropped in favor of #19)
* `tryWith` returning `Try[T]` does not work well with nested `tryWith`s (#19)
